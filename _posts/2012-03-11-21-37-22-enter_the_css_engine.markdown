#Enter the CSS Engine

CSS engines are relatively new approach to dealing with some of the shortcomings of CSS

There are many different CSS engines, e.g. SASS, LESS, Stylus, ...

They are domain specific languages, DSL, that output standard CSS.

There is translation/compilation process that converts the DSL to CSS. The browser really doesn't care how it was created.
